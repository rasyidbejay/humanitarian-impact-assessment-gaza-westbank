# Executive Summary

**Project**: Humanitarian Impact Assessment – Gaza and West Bank  
**Period Analysed**: October 2023 – March 2025  
**Author**: Mohammad Rashid Abdullah

This project examines the humanitarian consequences of the Gaza and West Bank conflict, focusing on three critical areas: civilian casualties, journalist fatalities, and public infrastructure damage.

Using datasets collected from public sources, the project applied data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisation techniques to uncover significant patterns. Key findings revealed a sharp disparity in casualty rates between Gaza and the West Bank, clustering of journalist deaths around periods of escalation, and extensive damage to schools and hospitals in conflict zones.

These insights aim to inform humanitarian actors, media organisations, and the public on the scale and timing of the crisis, supporting efforts in resource planning, policy response, and public advocacy.
